# Solution: Implement Breadth-First Search
## Statement: 
Given a directed graph represented as an adjacency list, graph, and an integer, source, which is the starting vertex number, return an array of integers, result, that contains the order of the graphâ€™s breadth-first traversal starting from the source vertex.
# Solution2: Implement Depth-First Search
## Statement: 
Given a directed graph represented by an adjacency array graph and an integer source, representing the start vertex of the graph, return an array of integers, result that shows the order of depth-first traversal starting from the specified source vertex.
# Solutio3: Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
## Statement:
Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle and return a boolean value accordingly.

A cycle occurs when you can start at one vertex, follow a path through the edges, and return to the starting vertex. This means at least one vertex is visited more than once within the same traversal path.
